Purpose: Train, save, and serve the travel-time predictor (and optional classifier).

Core contents:

Training pipeline: load engineered X/y, split, fit a fast tabular regressor (e.g., gradient boosting/XGBoost), evaluate MAE, and persist model + feature list.

Inference functions: predict_travel_time(next_horizon_features) â†’ array; batch predict for all active trains.

Model IO: save/load model artifacts; ensure identical feature ordering and preprocessing at train and inference time.

Optional: simple feature importance export (for explainability in UI).

Outputs: model.pkl (or similar), feature_names.json, and a thin predict API callable from simulator or the UI.
